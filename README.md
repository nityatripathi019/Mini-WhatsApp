## Mini WhatsApp Chat App

This is a basic web-based **Mini WhatsApp Chat App** that allows users to perform **CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete)** operations on chat messages. 

### Features:
- **Create new chats**: Users can add new chat messages.
- **Edit existing chats**: Users can update previously sent messages.
- **Delete chats**: Users can remove chat messages.
